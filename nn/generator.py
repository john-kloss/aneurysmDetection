    """
    Creates the training and validation generators that can be used when training the model.
    :param skip_blank: If True, any blank (all-zero) label images/patches will be skipped by the data generator.
    :param validation_batch_size: Batch size for the validation data.
    :param training_patch_start_offset: Tuple of length 3 containing integer values. Training data will randomly be
    offset by a number of pixels between (0, 0, 0) and the given tuple. (default is None)
    :param validation_patch_overlap: Number of pixels/voxels that will be overlapped in the validation data. (requires
    patch_shape to not be None)
    :param patch_shape: Shape of the data to return with the generator. If None, the whole image will be returned.
    (default is None)
    :param augment_flip: if True and augment is True, then the data will be randomly flipped along the x, y and z axis
    :param augment_distortion_factor: if augment is True, this determines the standard deviation from the original
    that the data will be distorted (in a stretching or shrinking fashion). Set to None, False, or 0 to prevent the
    augmentation from distorting the data in this way.
    :param augment: If True, training data will be distorted on the fly so as to avoid over-fitting.
    :param labels: List or tuple containing the ordered label values in the image files. The length of the list or tuple
    should be equal to the n_labels value.
    Example: (10, 25, 50)
    The data generator would then return binary truth arrays representing the labels 10, 25, and 30 in that order.
    :param data_file: hdf5 file to load the data from.
    :param batch_size: Size of the batches that the training generator will provide.
    :param n_labels: Number of binary labels.
    :param training_keys_file: Pickle file where the index locations of the training data will be stored.
    :param validation_keys_file: Pickle file where the index locations of the validation data will be stored.
    :param data_split: How the training and validation data will be split. 0 means all the data will be used for
    validation and none of it will be used for training. 1 means that all the data will be used for training and none
    will be used for validation. Default is 0.8 or 80%.
    :param overwrite: If set to True, previous files will be overwritten. The default mode is false, so that the
    training and validation splits won't be overwritten when rerunning model training.
    :param permute: will randomly permute the data (data must be 3D cube)
    :return: Training data generator, validation data generator, number of training steps, number of validation steps
